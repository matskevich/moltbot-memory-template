# Synthesis

## Purpose

Aggregate findings from multiple aspect research files. Identify cross-aspect patterns, generate insights, calculate quality metrics.

## Components

| Skill | Role |
|-------|------|
| grounding-protocol | Ensure no hallucination in synthesis |
| anti-cringe | Quality filter for insight descriptions |

## Input

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `aspects_path` | string | Path to aspects/ directory |
| `plan_path` | string | Path to plan.yaml (optional) |

## Procedure

### Step 1: Load All Aspect Files

```
aspects = Glob("artifacts/{session}/aspects/*.yaml")
for each file:
  aspect_data = Read(file)
  collect all findings
```

### Step 2: Deduplicate Findings

Across aspects, findings may overlap. Deduplicate by:
1. Exact URL match → keep higher tier version
2. Semantic similarity → merge, cite both sources

### Step 3: API Performance Comparison (V2 only)

If aspects used dual-search (aspect-researcher-v2):

**Aggregate metrics:**
```yaml
api_comparison:
  exa:
    total_results: 45
    unique_urls: 38
    avg_tier: "A"
    s_tier_sources: 12
    avg_recency_weight: 0.78
    empty_queries: 3  # queries that returned 0 results
  
  brave:
    total_results: 67
    unique_urls: 52
    avg_tier: "B"
    s_tier_sources: 8
    avg_recency_weight: 0.91
    empty_queries: 0
  
  overlap:
    shared_urls: 15
    agreement_rate: 0.25  # overlap / total_unique
  
  insights:
    - "Brave superior for breaking news (2026-01 content)"
    - "Exa superior for technical depth (S-tier: 60% vs 15%)"
    - "Exa indexing lag: 3/7 aspects returned 0 results"
    - "Recommendation: Use Brave for time-sensitive, Exa for evergreen"
```

**Per-aspect API winner:**
```yaml
aspect_api_winners:
  - aspect: "prompt-patterns"
    winner: "brave"
    reason: "Exa: 0 results. Brave: 12 results"
  
  - aspect: "integrations"
    winner: "exa"
    reason: "Higher tier sources (S: 4 vs 1)"
```

### Step 4: Identify Cross-Aspect Patterns

Look for:
- **Recurring themes:** Same concept in 2+ aspects
- **Contradictions:** Conflicting claims → note both
- **Causal chains:** A (aspect 1) enables B (aspect 2)
- **Gaps:** Expected topics not covered

For each pattern:
```yaml
pattern: "Description of pattern"
type: recurring|contradiction|causal|gap
aspects: ["aspect_1", "aspect_3"]
evidence:
  - finding_id: "f001"
    aspect: "aspect_1"
  - finding_id: "f012"
    aspect: "aspect_3"
strength: 3  # Number of supporting findings
```

### Step 4: Generate Insights

From patterns and strong findings, generate insights:

**Insight criteria:**
- Supported by 2+ sources
- Non-obvious (not just restating a finding)
- Actionable or informative

```yaml
insight:
  id: "i001"
  title: "Short title"
  description: "Clear statement of the insight"
  evidence:
    - finding_id: "f001"
      weight: 0.8
    - finding_id: "f012"
      weight: 0.6
  confidence: high|medium|low
  type: observation|recommendation|warning
```

**Confidence levels:**
| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| high | 3+ S/A sources, no contradictions |
| medium | 2+ sources OR B-tier majority |
| low | Single source OR contradictions exist |

### Step 5: Calculate Quality Metrics

```yaml
saturation: # Information completeness (0-100)
  formula: (unique_topics_covered / expected_topics) * 100
  threshold: 50

diversity: # Source variety (0-1)
  formula: unique_domains / total_sources
  threshold: 0.5

tier_quality: # Weighted average of source tiers
  formula: sum(tier_weight * source_count) / total_sources
  threshold: 0.6

evidence_depth: # Average findings per insight
  formula: total_findings / total_insights
  threshold: 3
```

### Step 6: Organize by Themes

Group insights into themes for report structure:

```yaml
themes:
  - name: "Theme Name"
    description: "What this theme covers"
    insights: ["i001", "i003", "i007"]
    primary_aspects: ["aspect_1", "aspect_2"]
```
