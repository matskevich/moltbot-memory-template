# IO YAML Safe

## Purpose

Ensure YAML files are written correctly with proper structure, validation, and atomic writes. Prevent corrupted or invalid output.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Validate Structure

Before writing:
- Ensure data is valid YAML-serializable
- Check required fields present
- Validate against schema (if provided)

### Step 2: Format Content

```yaml
# Header comment with context
# Generated by: {agent_name}
# Created at: {timestamp}

{content}
```

### Step 3: Write Atomically

1. Write to temporary file first
2. Validate written content is readable
3. Move to final location

### Step 4: Verify

After write:
- Read back the file
- Ensure content matches intent
- Log success/failure

## YAML Best Practices

### Use Block Scalars for Multi-line

```yaml
# Good
description: |
  This is a long description
  that spans multiple lines.

# Bad
description: "This is a long description\nthat spans multiple lines."
```

### Quote Strings When Needed

```yaml
# These need quotes
title: "Yes"           # Would be boolean
version: "1.0"         # Could be float
path: "C:\\Users"      # Contains backslash

# These don't need quotes
name: my-agent
count: 42
```

### Consistent Indentation

Always use 2 spaces, never tabs.

### Arrays

```yaml
# Preferred for short items
tags: [tech, research, ai]

# Use block for complex items
items:
  - id: 1
    name: First
  - id: 2
    name: Second
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Invalid YAML structure | Log error, do not write |
| Schema validation fail | Log specific fields, do not write |
| Write permission denied | Propagate error to caller |
| Disk full | Propagate error to caller |

## Integration

All agents writing YAML output should:
1. Include this skill in required skills
2. Use Write tool for output
3. Follow formatting guidelines
4. Include metadata section
